High contiguity Arabidopsis thaliana genome assembly with a single nanopore flow cell.

## Data
    Raw sequencing data were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under project PRJEB21270. 
    
    Raw Bionano Genomics molecules and assembled maps are deposited under BioProject ID PRJNA390205. 
    
    Final polished assemblies were deposited in the ENA Genome Assembly Database: PacBio Sequel, PRJEB23084 and Oxford Nanopore MinION, PRJEB21270. 
    
    Code snippets and further data were deposited at GitHub (https://github.com/fbemm/onefc-oneasm).
